## Schema

### Required

- `hold` (Boolean) If true, the zone hold will be enabled. If false, the zone hold will be disabled.
- `zone_id` (String) The zone identifier to target for the resource. **Modifying this attribute will force creation of a new resource.**

### Optional

- `include_subdomains` (Boolean) If provided, the zone hold will extend to block any subdomain of the given zone, as well as SSL4SaaS Custom Hostnames.
- `hold_after` (String) If provided, when hold is false, the hold will be temporarily disabled, then automatically re-enabled by the system at the time specified in this RFC3339-formatted timestamp. Otherwise, the hold will be disabled indefinitely.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import cloudflare_zone_hold.example <zone_id>
```
